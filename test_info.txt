My test repo
Now that Git is tracking readme.txt we need to create a mile-
stone to indicate the changes that we made to readme.txt . In
this case, the changes that we made were creating the file in
the first place! This milestone is called a commit in Git. A
commit logs the content of all of the currently staged files.
Right now we only have readme.txt staged so let’s commit
the creation of this file. When making a Git commit, we need
to write a commit message which is specified after the -m flag.
The message should briefly describe what changes you’ve
made since the last commit.
